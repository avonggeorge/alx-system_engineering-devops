## About this project

>In this web stack debugging task, we are testing how well our web server setup featuring Nginx is doing under pressure and it turns out itâ€™s not doing well: we are getting a huge amount of failed requests.
## Approach 
- We will be using ApacheBench which is a quite popular tool in the industry. It allows you to simulate HTTP requests to a web server. In this case, I will make 2000 requests to my server with 100 requests at a time.
